# AI-Powered Pneumonia Detection

## 🚀 Project Overview
Developed a **deep learning model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **TensorFlow** to detect **pneumonia from chest X-ray images**. The model was fine-tuned for high accuracy using **OpenCV** for advanced image preprocessing and evaluated with robust performance metrics.

## 🏆 Key Features
- **CNN-Based Model**: Built using TensorFlow, achieving **92.6% accuracy**.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Processed **5,216 X-ray images** with OpenCV to enhance model performance.
- **Optimized Training**: Model trained for **25 epochs** with tuned hyperparameters.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieved **90% precision and 94% recall**, validated using a **Confusion Matrix and Classification Report**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled chest X-ray images categorized into **Normal** and **Pneumonia** cases. It was sourced from [Kaggle's Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com) (or mention the specific source if available).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
